# Compiled Library

This directory contains sources for the `libflacarray` compiled library.
There are some standard C source files and the output library is wrapped by
Cython in the parent directory.

You should not have to modify any files in this directory unless you are working
with the code that directly calls libFLAC.

There is also a small, compiled test that is installed.
